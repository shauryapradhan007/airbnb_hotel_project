# Airbnb EDA project

SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT : -

Airbnb, an abbreviation for "air mattress B&B," has a fairly simple structure on the outside. 

Hosts can use the site to rent out extra spaces in their house or apartment to travelers - typically for much cheaper than hotel lodgings. And, with Airbnb's presence in over 81,000 cities and 192 worldwide countries, if you have internet access, you can pretty much use the service anywhere.

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. This dataset describes all the listing activity of homestays in New York City.NYC is not only the most famous city in the world but also top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants and commerce.

Different variables in our dataset price, name, host id, host name, Neighborhood-group, neighborhood, latitude, longitude, room-type, minimum-nights, number of reviews, last review, review per month, calculated host listings, and availability 365 days.

One of the biggest challenges for companies is to maintain positive customer experience along with having a financially profitable business model for property owners. How factors are affecting the price for the Airbnb listing in NYC? What is the overall location distribution of Airbnb NYC? Which neighborhood has a better average price for the Airbnb listing?

We will be doing analysis on every Airbnb listing based on their
location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related
factors.
 
Our objective would be to find out the key metrics that influence the listing of
properties on the platform.
